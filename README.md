#StoryBook 
===
##Overveiw
Storybook is an app that makes use of authentication and authorizaton, flickr api and masonry.

A user signs up, logs in and can post stories which get a set of pictures grabbed from flickr and inserted into a nice masonry backdrop.

###Built with:
* Masonry
* Node.js
* Express
* flickr api
* postgresSQL
* bootstrap


###### Motivation

 I will continue building this up with the intent for parents to use this to get fun short stories to read to their kids, for free, on tablets or other mobile devices.
 
###### Next step
In the future the posts themselves will also be inserted into the masonry, so that as you read your story all parts are interactive and interestingly formatted. Users will not have to log in to use existing stories, but will to post.
